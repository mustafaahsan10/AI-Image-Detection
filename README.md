AI-Generated Image Forgery Detection Project
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting forgeries in AI-generated images. We focus on analyzing visual content to identify inconsistencies and anomalies that signify a forged image.

Dataset
We utilized a subset of images from the DiffusionDB dataset, a comprehensive collection of AI-generated images. Due to processing constraints, we selectively used 5,000 images for this project.

About DiffusionDB
DiffusionDB is the first large-scale text-to-image prompt dataset, boasting 14 million images generated by Stable Diffusion based on prompts and hyperparameters provided by real users. It serves as an extensive source for AI-generated imagery, offering a diverse range of visuals for various applications, including machine learning and image analysis.

Dataset Selection
Our subset of 5,000 images was chosen based on specific criteria to ensure a representative and diverse sample suitable for training our forgery detection model. The selection was limited by processor constraints, guiding us to prioritize images that would provide the most value to our analysis and model training.

Model Development
The core of our project involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) tailored to identify and differentiate forged images from authentic AI-generated ones. The model training and evaluation processes are designed to optimize performance and ensure accurate forgery detection.

Training
The model is trained on the 5,000 selected AI-generated images, using advanced techniques to maximize the learning from our dataset.

Evaluation
We employ rigorous testing and validation methods to assess the model's performance, focusing on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure comprehensive evaluation.

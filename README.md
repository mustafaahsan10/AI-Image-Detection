# AI-Generated Image Detection Project

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to detect AI-generated images. Our focus is on analyzing visual content to identify characteristics unique to images produced by AI.

## Dataset
We used a subset of images from the DiffusionDB dataset, one of the most extensive collections of AI-generated images.

### About DiffusionDB
[DiffusionDB](https://poloclub.github.io/diffusiondb/) is the first large-scale text-to-image prompt dataset, containing 14 million images generated by Stable Diffusion with prompts and hyperparameters specified by real users. It serves as a vast resource for AI-generated imagery, offering a wide range of visuals for machine learning and image analysis.

### Dataset Selection
For this project, we selected 5,000 images from DiffusionDB. This selection was primarily due to processor constraints, ensuring a manageable yet diverse sample of images for training our detection model.

## Model Development
The project's core is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can accurately identify AI-generated images. We focus on tuning and evaluating our model to achieve high performance in this detection task.

### Training
The model is trained on the 5,000 AI-generated images from DiffusionDB, utilizing advanced techniques to learn effectively from this dataset.

### Evaluation
We conduct thorough testing and validation to assess the model's detection capabilities, focusing on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to provide a comprehensive evaluation.

## Getting Started
Here we will provide instructions for setting up the project, including how to install dependencies and prepare the dataset for training and evaluation.

## Usage
This section will detail how to use the model for detecting AI-generated images, including command line arguments, API usage, or user interfaces, as applicable.
